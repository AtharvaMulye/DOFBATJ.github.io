            Hello, Justa❤️! It's me, Atum (ATHARVA)🫂.<br />I realize I made a
            tremendous mistake, and I've been incredibly arrogant and foolish in
            recent days...<br />
            You advised me to think carefully about what I wanted to do.You also
            told me how to go about it and who I should listen to.<br />
            But I didn't do it. I assumed I could do whatever I wanted, but I
            quickly realized how naive I was in this case.<br />
            I believed I could pick the greatest tools and stack and construct
            the best website, but I was so wrong...I spoke with arrogance and
            ignorance without giving much thought to anything.😞

            I've come to a heartfelt realization about the magnitude of my
            actions and the impact they've had on you.😞<br />
            My behavior was nothing short of stupid, and I deeply regret the
            upset and anger I caused you.<br />
            In my misguided confidence, I believed I knew better, only to
            discover that I was entirely ignorant about the subject at hand.<br />
            Now, as the weight of my actions settles in, I find myself genuinely
            upset and frustrated with the person I allowed myself to become🥺.

            Justa❤️, I come to you with a heart full of regret and a sincere
            request for forgiveness🥺<br />
            I am acutely aware of the pain I've caused, and I deeply apologize
            for making you feel angry, sad, and unvalued😞. In my actions, I
            realize I have conveyed a sense of ignorance and disregard, and for
            that, I am truly sorry.
            <br />
            I want you to know that your presence and opinions mean the world to
            me. It pains me to think that I have given you a different
            impression. From the depths of my heart, I extend my heartfelt
            apologies❤️.
            <br />
            You are incredibly precious to me, and your sweetness enriches my
            life. I want to assure you that I've reflected on my actions, and I
            am committed to never repeating such horrendous behavior. I value
            you immensely, and I've made a decision to never do anything which
            will make you angry on your Chubba again🫂<br />

            My Motu Justa Dabba Chickuuu❤️🫂..You are adorable and lovely💕...I
            sometimes wonder how I ended up with a bestie like you who, despite
            me being an idiot, always sticks by me😎...<br />You have no idea
            how proud I am when someone says Justina is smart and clever...<br />I've
            learned so much from you, from good habits to literally leaving some
            strange things I used to do...<br />
            I am really thankful to have such a nice and short(Batli) and motu
            in my life🫂🔪🔪.
